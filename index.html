                        <p>During my time at H&M, I gained extensive experience across multiple aspects of retail operations.<br> 
                            I <strong>provided great customer service</strong>, through assisting customers with inquiries, and creating a positive shopping experience.<br>
                            I also <strong>handled transactions </strong>efficiently and accurately as a cashier, while <strong>maintaining a tidy and organized department</strong><br>
                            to create a pleasant shopping environment. In addition, I <strong>managed the fitting rooms</strong>, ensuring cleanliness and smooth customer flow.<br>
                            I was actively involved in <strong>inventory management</strong>, including restocking and maintaining stock accuracy, as well as contributing to<br>
                            <strong>visual merchandising </strong>by arranging displays to enhance store presentation. Beyond these operational tasks, I also <br>
                            <strong>mentored new part-time staff</strong>, sharing knowledge on store processes and best practices in customer service.</p>

                                <p>I have served as a Sales Advisor at the then-Waterway Point Outlet for 2.5 years.<br>
                                Throughout my time there, I have gained valuable experience in customer service and retail operations.<br>
                                I was entrusted by my managers to train some of the new part-timers, which helped me develop my leadership skills.<br>
                                Furthermore, I took the initiative to carry out Visual Merchandising and Inventory Management tasks.</p>
                                I left the Waterway Point Outlet in September 2019 due to my National Service enlistment in October 2019.<br>

                                In September 2017, my store manager in the then-Waterway Point outlet gave me the opportunity to support<br>
                                    the then-ION Orchard outlet with the launch of the H&M's cosmestic line, H&M Beauty Department, for 3 days.<br>
                                    ION Orchard outlet is one of the top outlets in Singapore, so it was a valuable experience to understand<br>
                                    how they operated their store, and the difference between the store located in the city<br>
                                    and the heartland store like Waterway Point.

                                    In my 3 days of support, I was mainly involved in assisting with the store operations<br>
                                    and customer service during the busy period.<br>
                                    This experience allowed me to adapt quickly to a new environment,<br>

                                    It was a brand new experience for me as the country was in the midst of the covid pandemic.<br>
                                    On top of the daily store operation tasks such as customer service, cashiering, and inventory management,<br>
                                    I also carried out Safe Entry tasks such as checking customers' vaccination status.<br>
                                    Apart from that, I was working in the Ladies and H&M HOME departments, which are the front-facing departments of the store<br>
                                    as both departments are located at the first floor of the store.<br>

                                    As I hit my 5 years of service with H&M in May 2024, I was admitted into the H&M Incentive Program (HIP),<br>
                                    which recognizes and rewards long-serving employees for their commitment and contributions to the company.<br>
                                    This program made me feel valued and appreciated for my long service with the company.<br>
                                    I left the company in December 2024 due to my final semester of studies.<br>
                                    Overall, my time with H&M has been a rewarding experience, and I have learned a lot about retail operations and customer service.<br>
                                    I have also developed my leadership skills through training new part-timers and being entrusted with various responsibilities.<br>
                                    I am always open to new opportunities, and I look forward to rejoining H&M in the future if the opportunity arises.<br>
